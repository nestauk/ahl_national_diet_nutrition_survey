# National Diet and Nutrition Survey

The National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme (NDNS RP) is a cross-sectional survey with a continuous programme of fieldwork, designed to assess the diet, nutrient intake and nutritional status of the general population aged 1.5 years and over living in private households in the UK.

The NDNS provides the only source of nationally representative UK data on the types and quantities of foods consumed by individuals, from which estimates of nutrient intake for the population are derived and on their nutritional status from 
analysis of blood and urinary biomarkers. Results are used by government to monitor progress toward diet and nutrition objectives of UK Health Departments and develop policy interventions.
